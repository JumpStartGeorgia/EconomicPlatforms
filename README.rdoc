=== *******HACK**********
In order to get paper_trail and globalize3 to work nicely together, the globalize3 gem
had to be hacked.  At globalize3-0.2.0/lib/globalize/active_record/translation.rb, the
locale method was changed to check if a locale file existed before trying to convert to
a symbol.  The change is listed below.

def locale
  read_attribute(:locale).to_sym if read_attribute(:locale)
end
